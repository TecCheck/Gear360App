# Gear360App
A Gear 360 app that is opensource and should work better than the original one

### The goal of this app
This app should be smaller, not as resource intensive and comatible with most of the android devices out there.
And of course it's open source.

### Features that should be in the app
* Live View with different modes (for example lightweight which doesn't stich the footage and normal which does)
* Remote shutter
* Modify settings of the camera
* View the recorded photos and videos of the camera

### State of progress
The app is more or less a alpha version. Things are being tested, the original app is being reverse engineered and my brain is being melted and curently some basic Bluetooth communication is possible:
* Making photos or videos
* Getting some infos about the Gear360
